# Maya 2019 Fundamentals: Overview and Modeling

# Getting Started with Maya
- The first step is to get familiar with the basic interface:
![Maya Interface](images/maya-interface.png)
- The taskbar options will change based on what kind of task you're working on:
![Maya Task Focus](images/taskbar-task-setting.png)
- This is the default view and there are some pre-defined templates to modify the workspace:
![Maya Workspace Changing](images/maya-workspace-selection.png)
- You can configure and Select tools from the Shelf in the UI:
![Maya Shelf: Configuration and Tools](images/maya-tools-and-shelf.png)
![Maya Channel Box Editor](images/channel-box-layer-editor.png)
- The Animation Toolbar is on the bottom:
![Maya Animation Toolbar](images/animation-toolbar.png)
- You can change the viewport for the model on the sidebar:
![Maya Viewport Sidebar](images/viewport-settings-sidebar.png)
- You can rotate the model using `ALT+LMB`.
- You can control the zoom level using `ALT+RMB`.
- You can move side to side using the `ALT+MMB` or middle mouse button.
- If you're having issues finding or viewing objects, then you can use the **Outliner tool**:

- If you click on the object and click `f` then it will center on that object.
- If you hit the `a` button then it will *frame up* on everything.
- You can also hit the `spacebar` to change the viewport.
- If you want to switch to a particular viewport then hover with the mouse in the view and press `spacebar` again.
- If you hold the `spacebar` then you can view the **Hotbox** which has lots of other options and views.

- Maya's solution to organizing files is called a **Project**.
- You can create a new Project under **Project Window** option under File.
- To select something, make sure that the **Select Tool** is active.
- You can also press the `q` key on your keyboard.
- Then, you'll want to click on that object.
- You can select multiple parts using `SHIFT+LMB`.
- You can delect by holding down `CTRL` then `LMB`.
- You can also click down `LMB` and then drag the marquee to select multiple objects.
- There is a heirarchy relationship that can be setup but that will be discussed later.
- There are three **Transforms**:
  1. Movement (`w`).
  2. Rotation (`e`).
  3. Scaling  (`r`).
- Here is what the move tool looks like:
![Move Tool](images/move-gizmo.png)
- Here is what the rotate tool looks like:
![Rotate Tool](images/rotate-gizmo.png)
- Scale starts at 1 instead of 0.
- Now to create Geometries:
![Example of a Cube](images/created-cube.png)
- The **Outliner** shows a list of everything in the scene.
- To group objects together, select them in the Outliner window and hit the `p` key.
- Don't forget that there is a display layer listing all the things in the scene as well.
![Display Layer for Objects](images/display-layer-window-box.png)
- The third box on the object controls how it should display:
  * Blank means normal.
  * T means template.
  * R means reference; looks the same but no selection.
- To add something to that layer, you'd select an object and right click:
![Add Object to Layer](images/add-object-to-layer.png)
- You can create a new group from objects using `CTRL+G` in outliner once objects are selected.
- If you select one object but want the group, then click the `ARROW UP` and you will move up the heirarchy.
- The most basic geometry is called a **Polygon**.
- In order to see the components of a *polygon*, we need to go to **Component Mode**.
- You can `RMB` to get it:
![Compnent Hotbar](images/component-hotbar.png)
- ... or in the toolbar:
![Component Toolbar Location](images/component-toolbar-tool.png)
- Or, hit `F8`.
- The first basic component is a **Vertex** which is a coordinate in 3D space.
- You will hear about **Polygon Faces** in three sections:
  1. Triangles.
  2. Quads.
  3. N-gon
- Typically, quads are used when using malformed polygons more often.
- If you select an object and hit `3` then you'll get a presentation of a smoothed version of the object.
- If you hit `2` then you can see the cage for the object.
- You can increae the amount of subdivisions to improve the smoothing:
![Increase Polygon Primitve using Subdivisions](images/subdivisions-for-poly-primatives.png)
- You can return to the base cube by pressing `1`.
- The next kind is a different category called a **Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline** or **NURB**.
