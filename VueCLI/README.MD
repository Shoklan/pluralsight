# Developing Faster With the Vue CLI
## John Papa

# Getting Started with the Vue CLI
- First we need to get it installed and we do that with:
```
npm i -g @vue/cli @vue/cli-service-global
```
- Once the App.vue is created, you can just run `vue server -o` and it will start it.
- Now that you have this online, you can play with it to configure it.
- It also will check for when the file updates and will autoreload it.
- This allows us to have a rapid development experience.
- It can also do some optimizations.
- To create a new project you'd run `vue create <project-name> -d`.
- The `-d` flag means to use the defaults.
- Vue also has a `serve` script to start a project using `npm run serve`.
- You can use the `--help` to get help info at any command depth.
- By default, it will add three scripts: `lint`, `build`, `server`.
- You're not limited to the console but can start a Vue CLI UI.


# Setting UP the Vue CLI
- Now we're going to talk about the prerequisites for Vue CLI.
- The first one is Node.js .
- One that's installed, you'll of course install vue like above.
- You can also use yarn: `yarn global add @vue/cli`.
- It's a good idea to verify the version with `--version`.
- You can start the UI version with the command `vue ui`.


# Mastering Essential Vue Tools
- Now we'll explore a range of topics around the browser, console, etc.
- You can instantiate a vue project without the beginner scaffolding using `-b` of `create`.
- There is a plugin for the browser called **vue-devtools** that will present a better interface for Vue Projects in your browser.
