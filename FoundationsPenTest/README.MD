# Laying the Foundation for Penetration Testing for CompTIA PenTest+
## Dale Meredith

# Penetration Testing Foundations
- **Pentesting** is a way to think about your existing environment how an attacker would look at it.
- The two points we're interested in are:
  1. How they get in.
  2. What they found.
- *"If I can physically get to your device then you don't own it anymore."*
- There is a difference between **Vulnerability Assessment** and **Pentest**.
- With the *Vulnerability Assessment*, we're using mostly automated testing.
- With the *Pentest*, we're finding and executing on what is found to see if it works.
- **Red Team** means attackers; **Blue Team** means defenders.
- **Frameworks** are here for the layout or blueprint to work with.
- Frameworks:
  * CHECK from the UK Governemnt.
  * OWASP from the Open Web Application Security Project.
  * OSSTMM from the Open Source Security Testing Methedology Manual.
  * PTES from the Penetration Testing Exwcution Standard.
  * NIST SP 800-115 from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology.
- Phases of Pentesting:
  1. Planning.
  2. Reconnaissance.
  3. Scanning.
  4. Gaining Acccss.
  5. Maintaining Access.
  6. Cover your Tracks.
  7. Analysis.
  8. Reporting.
- Tools!
- **The Chain of Command** is who should know what.
- **Client Counterparts** should have a close relationship with the client and the Pentest team.
- Make sure you cover you bases with contracts.
  * NDAs.
  * Master Service Agreement.
  * Statement of Work.
- Who can authorize the pentest?
- Who is doing the pentest?
- Which hosts can be targets?
- Beware of Export Restrictions in some companies.
- Organizational Policies?
- National and Local Restrictions.


# Setting up a Lab Environment to Pentet
- You will need to reboot since Windows will put the OS right on top of the Hypervisor Interface.
- Now we're going to isolate them using the Virtual Switch Manager from Hyper-V.
- Each type of Virtual Switch is:
  * External: Can access the physical network adapter.
    - Expect to lose connectivity when this is applied.
  * Internal: Only be used by VMs running on this Virtual host and the host.
  * Private: Only be used by VMs running on the host.
- Alternatively, one could use VMWare instead of Hyper-V.
- Reminder that you cannot run both Hypervisors on the same machine.
- To manager the Virtual Switches in VMWare Workstation, you'd want to use *Edit* > *Virtual Networking Editor*.
- In **Bridge Mode**, it will get its own IP address like a real host on the network.
- In **NAT Mode** all the VMs will share a single IP that will be NAT'd by VMware.
